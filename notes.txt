George Dasher asked about the International Foot as opposed to the US Survey
Foot.  Various states will, by law, use one or the other for their
'standard' in State Plane Coordinate surveys.  Arizona uses the
International Foot.

Question
How does a US Foot differ from an International Foot?

Answer
According to the Geodetic Glossary of the National Geodetic Survey (page
82), a survey foot is a unit of length defined as 1/3 of a yard and equal in
the US, since 1866, to exactly 1200/3937 (0.304800609) of a metre. The terms
US foot and survey foot are used interchangeably in North America.

The International foot is exactly 1/3 of the international yard, or exactly
0.3048 metres. The International foot was defined, for scientific purposes
by the 1959 agreement between the US NBS and similar organisations in other
countries.

 US foot 0.3048006096 metres (to ten decimal places)
  International foot 0.3048 metres
