# cave-survey

This is some old code written orginally in 2001 to convert Compass and SURVEY.EXE format cave survey data into the format needed for [survex](http://survex.com/). While I'm at least taking the step of migrating the old repo forward to git, this software has not been run in many years and I am not sure of its state.
